# LRUCache
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It
 should support the following operations: <b>get</b> and <b>put</b>.<br/><br/>
 <b>get(key)</b> - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key 
 exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.<br/><br/><b>put(key, value)</b> - 
 Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.<br/><br/> 
When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently 
used item before inserting a new item.<br/><br/>
Each operation should work with O(1) time complexity.

	public class LRUCache {

	  public LRUCache(int capacity) {
	  }
	
	  public int get(int key) {
	  }
	
	  public void put(int key, int value) {
	  }
	}
